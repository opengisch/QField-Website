        In January 2022 the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai submarine volcano erupted. Ash clouds from the eruption and the subsequent tsunami damaged croplands on the Tongatapu and Ha'apai island groups. The internet cable to Tonga was severed during the eruption. In particular, QField was used to generate maps of where fields had been cleared and re-ploughed using government support.
