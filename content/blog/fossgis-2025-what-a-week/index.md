As long time sponsors of FOSSGIS, we stepped up the game this year and became **Platinum Sponsors for FOSSGIS 2025**. We are proud to be part of a thriving open-source GIS community and to contribute to such a great conference. Here's a recap of everything we were involved in:

### 🚀 Talks & Presentations

**🌍 QField: New Strategy and Application Potential**  
_Berit_ and _Marco_ presented how QField, with over 1 million downloads and 350,000 active users, is now recognized as Digital Public Good aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Marco also shared the vision and mission behind QField’s development — highlighting our commitment to **empowering field teams** across the globe with **open, user-friendly tools for data collection**.  
Real-world stories illustrated how QField helps bridge data gaps to support informed, sustainable decision-making.

**⚙️ QField in Practice: Fieldwork Made Easy**  
Berit and Michael led an interactive workshop demonstrating how to develop a QField project from scratch. The goal was for each participant to create and sync their own field study project using QFieldCloud, focused on collecting data on flowering plants in the picturesque "Schlussgarten."

### 🤝 At the Booth

Our QField booth was buzzing with activity all week – from [plugin](https://github.com/topics/qfield-plugin) demos and project showcases to deep dives into [QFieldCloud](https://qfield.cloud) and field mapping workflows. We had great conversations, received valuable feedback, and met many enthusiastic users.
