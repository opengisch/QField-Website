It is with great pleasure that we want to announce the new name for what was briefly known as QGIS mobile.

### Please welcome QField for QGIS™!

After long thinking about various names and variants including QGIS mobile, QTouch, OPENGIS.ch QGIS mobile, QWork, and many more, we felt that QField represents best what we want to archive. A **field data capture and management app** fully compatible with [QGIS™](https://www.qgis.org "QGIS™").
QField allows you to take your QGIS projects out of the office for effective field work. By maintaining QGIS' styling and edit widgets QField greatly reduces preparation time.
QField is an Open Source project led by OPENGIS.ch LLC with the whole development happening on [Github](https://github.com/opengisch/QField/). Currently we are running an invite-only alpha testing but as soon as the app will have a bit more functionality we will widen up the testers group.
QField will be released for free on the Playstore with the possibility of [donating to the project via paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=X3TRREXGSC9CW) (preferred) or by buying the [QField for QGIS Karma edition app](https://qfield.opengis.ch/karma).
Another way to greatly help the project is, if you need a specific feature, [contact us](%20/contact/) to sponsor its development.
QField is built from ground up to be touch oriented and easy to use outside and follows the following paradigm:
● GPS centric
● QGIS desktop compatible
● Fully working when offline
● Synchronization capabilities
● Project preparation on desktop
● Few and large buttons
● Switchable use paradigm (Display, Digitizing, Measuring, Inspection,...)
QField is built using Qt5, QtQuick 2 (both are supported and suggested by Qt) and OpenGL so it is future proof and it spearheads QGIS towards Qt5.
For feature requests, please [contact us](/contact/ "Contact")
For bug reports [contact us](/contact/ "Contact") or better file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues)
