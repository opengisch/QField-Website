## Field data for precision agriculture
Collect observations, pests, nutrient deficiencies, and treatment records. Use standardized forms to maintain quality.

### Typical workflows
- Crop scouting and disease monitoring
- Soil sampling and fertility mapping
- Treatment records and compliance

## Integrated with QGIS and QFieldCloud
Build data models in QGIS and collaborate with QFieldCloud for timely decisions.
