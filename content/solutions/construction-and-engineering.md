## Field-ready construction data collection

QField lets site crews perform accurate surveys, stakeouts, and as-built capture with a simple mobile GIS. Forms, domains, and constraints from QGIS ensure consistent data entry.

### Why teams choose QField
- Works fully offline in demanding environments
- Real-time QA rules reduce rework
- Seamless sync to QGIS and QFieldCloud for collaboration

### Typical workflows
- Pre-construction site surveys and utilities locating
- As-built capture with photos and notes
- Punch lists, inspections, and issue tracking

## Integrates with QGIS and QFieldCloud

Prepare projects in QGIS, deploy to devices, and keep teams in sync with QFieldCloud. Maintain a single source of truth from design to handover.
