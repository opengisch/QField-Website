## Grid asset fieldwork
Inventory lines, poles, transformers, and substations. Capture conditions and defects with photos and attributes.

### Typical workflows
- Patrols and line inspections
- Vegetation encroachment surveys
- As-built capture and redlines

## One workflow from field to GIS
Prepare in QGIS, collect in QField, and sync through QFieldCloud for a clean audit trail.
