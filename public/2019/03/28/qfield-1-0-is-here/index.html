<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s official, QField for QGIS 1.0 is out!</p></blockquote>
<p>Get it while it’s hot on the Playstore ( <a href="https://qfield.org/get" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qfield.org/get</a>) or on <a href="https://github.com/opengisch/QField/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a></p>
<p>We are incredibly pleased and proud of just having released such a jewel and are convinced that, thanks to all its features and conscious design choices, QField will make your field digitizing work much more efficient and pleasant.</p>
<p>Packed with loads of useful features like online and offline features digitizing, geometry and attributes editing, attribute search, powerful forms, theme switching, GPS support, camera integration and much more, QField is the powerful tool for those who need to edit on the go and would like to avoid standing in the swamp with a laptop or paper charts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what makes QField probably[su_tooltip style=&ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; rounded=&ldquo;yes&rdquo; position=&ldquo;top&rdquo; content=&ldquo;We might be biased, but we do believe it&rdquo;]*[/su_tooltip] the best mobile GIS in the world.</p>
<h2 id="work-efficiently">Work efficiently</h2>
<p>QField focuses on efficiently getting GIS field work done and combines a minimal design with sophisticated technology to get data from the field to the office in a comfortable and easy way.</p>
<h3 id="fast-and-reactive">Fast and reactive</h3>
<p>Thanks to the underlying QGIS engine and a lot of optimizations, QField is powerful and snappy. Even with complex projects, QField is a joy to work with.</p>
<h3 id="easy-handling">Easy handling</h3>
<p>Conscious design choices and a continuous focus on a minimal user interface drive QField&rsquo;s development. This allows us to deliver a product wich is uncluttered and extremly user-friendly</p>
<h3 id="quickly-digitise">Quickly digitise</h3>
<p>Allowing a seamless digitizing experience is a paramount goal of QField. Thanks to a cleverly designed adaptive user interface and specific features like real-time attribute checks and snapping support, QField allows its users to be extremely time efficient.</p>
<h2 id="unmatched-feature-set">Unmatched feature set</h2>
<p>To be the best, you need to be clever but also skillful.</p>
<p>QField&rsquo;s efficiency is matched only by its featureset that allows its users to make the most out of their fieldwork time.</p>
<h3 id="powerful-cartography-combined-with-full-text-search">Powerful cartography combined with full text search</h3>
<p>The beauty of GIS is that maps are dynamic. Layers can individually be shown and hidden and information can be presented more or less prominently based on the task at hand. QField supports the endless styling possibilities offered by QGIS and thanks to a well placed theme switcher you can change the looks of the entire project with a single click. For even more customizability, QField allows hiding and showing layers by simply long-pressing on the layer name.</p>
<p>Furthermore, QField boasts a fully configurable attribute text search that will allow you to geolocate and edit that exact object you were looking for.</p>
<h3 id="geometry-editing">Geometry editing</h3>
<p>Editing Geometries on the field is probably the most complex task an operator has to deal with. QField simplifies this process through an adaptive toolbar that appears only when necessary, snapping support and a crosshair digitizer.</p>
<p>Thanks to these enhancements, QField allows reducing the error rate significantly.</p>
<h3 id="support-for-high-precision-gnss">Support for high precision GNSS</h3>
<p>Simple internal GPS accuracy might be enough for basic projects but cadastral surveying and other high accuracy digitizations have much higher requirements. QFields natively listens to the Android location services so it can take advantage of the best location provided by external devices.</p>

         >
  
  
</figure>
<h3 id="generate-pdf">Generate PDF</h3>
<p>Thanks to QField’s native support for generating PDFs based on QGIS’s print layouts, your on the fly daily report map is just one click away.</p>
<h3 id="intuitive-project-chooser">Intuitive project chooser</h3>
<p>When dealing with multiple projects, quickly being able to switch between them is key. QField comes with a beautiful file selector with favorite directories (long press on a folder to add it to the favorites and long press on the favorites list to remove it) and an automatic list of the last three opened projects that will save you heaps of time while looking for your projects.</p>
<h2 id="your-data---your-decisions">Your data - Your decisions</h2>
<p>QField does not impose any constraint on the data model, it is your data and you decide what they should look like and what values are acceptable. QField can enforce constraints for you and you can choose among various type of widgets to represent your data. QGIS will preconfigure some field types automatically, all you’ll have then to do is tweak the settings if you want and your project is ready for mobile prime time. Our <a href="https://www.qfield.org/docs/project-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> has all the information you need.</p>
<h2 id="extends-your-geo-data-infrastructure-seamlessly">Extends your Geo Data Infrastructure seamlessly</h2>
<p>QField uses QGIS to set up maps and forms so it automatically supports a wide variety of data formats. Thanks to this, you can comfortably prepare your project once and then deploy it everywhere. And since QGIS also has a server component, your project can be served on a WebGIS with the very same beautiful looks.</p>
<p>In fact you can see this exact infrastructure up and running under <a href="https://demo.qfield.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo.qfield.org</a> and with the &ldquo;online_survey.qgs&rdquo; project included in the QField demo projects.</p>
<h3 id="synchronize-with-wifi-cable-or-network">Synchronize with WiFi, Cable or Network</h3>
<p>You can synchronize your project and data (in case you are not using a centralized online database) using various methods thanks to our <a href="https://www.qfield.org/docs/qfieldsync/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QFieldSync</a> plugin.</p>
<h3 id="future-cloud-integration">Future cloud integration</h3>
<p>In the near future we will add a cloud synchronization functionality, so that you will be able to seamlessly manage your project online and have them automatically deployed to your devices.</p>
<h2 id="installing-and-contributing">Installing and contributing</h2>
<p>You can easily install QField using the Playstore ( <a href="https://qfield.org/get" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qfield.org/get</a>), find out more on the documentation site ( <a href="https://qfield.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qfield.org</a>), watch some demo videos on our channel ( <a href="https://qfield.org/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qfield.org/demo</a>) and report problems to our issues tracking system ( <a href="https://qfield.org/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qfield.org/issues</a>). Please note that the Playstore update can take some hours to roll out and if you had installed a version directly from <a href="https://github.com/opengisch/QField/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, you might have to uninstall it to get the latest Playstore update.</p>
<p>QField, like QGIS, is an open source project. Everyone is welcome to contribute to making the product even better – whether it is with financial support, <a href="https://www.transifex.com/opengisch/qfield-for-qgis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation</a>, <a href="https://www.qfield.org/docs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation work</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opengisch/QField" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enthusiastic programming</a> or <a href="https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visionary ideas</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank our fantastic community for all the great translations, documentations, bug reports and general feedback they gave us. Thanks to all this, we were able to fix plenty of bugs, address performance issues and even add some super cool new features.</p>
<h2 id="development-and-deployment-services">Development and deployment services</h2>
