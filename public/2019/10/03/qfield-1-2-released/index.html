  <p>After an intensive testing period, we are proud to announce the release of <strong>QField 1.2</strong></p>

<h2 id="qfield-crowdfunding-campaign">QField Crowdfunding Campaign</h2>
<p>Before digging into all the new goodness that you will find in QField 1.2, let&rsquo;s get some big &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; out. What QField currently is was mostly possible <strong>thanks to customer projects</strong> of which the outcome could be mutualized. Thanks a lot to all of you that agreed open source is all about making things possible together!</p>
<p>Over the years at OPENGIS.ch we have also <strong>donated an unimaginable amount of hours</strong> to make QField the project you have grown to love and this makes us very proud!</p>
<p>To keep the momentum we now rely on all QField users to help us move one step further. Therefore we created a <strong>crowdfunding campaign for improved camera support</strong>. As well as another round of <strong>general polishing and bug-fixing</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like QField, now is the time to show some love and <strong><a href="https://opengis.ch/qfield-love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support our crowdfunding campaign</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>
<p>This new release comes with exciting new features and also contains some first usability enhancements. More of that later.</p>
<h3 id="value-relation-widget">Value relation widget</h3>





  




<figure class="gallery-item"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/value-relation.gif" alt="" loading="lazy">
</figure>

<p>If you need to choose the type of a material of the manhole you are inspecting or to select the owner of the parcel which you are drawing, that&rsquo;s when you want a <strong>combo box with available values</strong>. This has been possible in QField for a long time, but was hard to set up. Since this release it&rsquo;s much easier thanks to the integration of value relation widgets.</p>
<p>Not only do they make configuration easier, they also allow for a completely new functionality: managing <strong>multiple selections</strong>. This will offer a checkbox for every possible value from the list and you are free to save any combination of values.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-dialog-for-protected-services">Authentication dialog for protected services</h3>





  




<figure class="gallery-item"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/login.gif" alt="" loading="lazy">
</figure>

<p>Just as well as we love open source, we love open data. But not all data are meant for public and some deserve protection. Even more you don&rsquo;t want to allow everyone to edit your data.</p>
<p>QField will now <strong>show an authentication dialog</strong>, whenever one of your <strong>WMS, WFS, WFS-T or Postgres layers</strong> requires a login.</p>
<h3 id="improved-snapping-support-in-expressions">Improved snapping support in expressions</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons for <strong>QField&rsquo;s incredible versatility</strong> is the <strong>use of</strong> <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/expression.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>expressions</strong></a> everywhere. We have just added yet another piece to that: when you snap to a feature, <strong>all the snapping details</strong> <strong>are available for your new feature</strong>. With this in place, if you add a new signpost on a street, you can fill in the <code>street_id</code> attribute automatically.</p>
<p>As a nice little extra, the Z (and M) values of snapping results are automatically applied to the new vertices and points.</p>
<h2 id="usability-enhancements-and-bugfixes">Usability enhancements and Bugfixes</h2>
<p>We also started to improve on the usability of the user interface. We are working on this with a usability expert to get the user interface to be even more appealing and user-friendly.</p>
<p>This is just the start, stay tuned for <strong>more usability improvements</strong> which are inbound.</p>
<p>As usual, a number of additional bugs have also been corrected, most notably the checkbox widget is now behaving as expected.</p>
<h2 id="latest-qt-513-and-arm64-v8a-support">Latest Qt 5.13 and Arm64-v8a support</h2>
<p>According to Google guidelines, we added support for the Arm64-v8a architecture and while we were at it, we also migrated to the shiny new Qt 5.13 and it&rsquo;s next-gen menu system.</p>
<p>For this release, we did not upload any x86 packages to the play store since it would have forced us to also have to upload an x86_64 package. If you need the x86 package, you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/opengisch/QField/releases/download/v1.2.0/qfield-v1.2.0-x86.apk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>. Obviously, in future releases we&rsquo;ll add those to the play store as well.</p>
