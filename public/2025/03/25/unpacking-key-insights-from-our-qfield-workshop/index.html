  <p>This year, <strong>OPENGIS.ch</strong> celebrated its 10th anniversary in Bern, with an afternoon full of workshops attended by clients, long-term friends, and colleagues. Here, we will give a glimpse of QField: <strong>its vision, where it&rsquo;s headed</strong>, and the <strong>exciting features future users can look forward to</strong>.</p>

<p>QField was created on June 8th, 2011, with its first commit titled “ <em>added first script</em>”. Since then, it has grown into a powerful tool with a clear vision for the future: <strong>to empower people to map and understand the world, tackle daily challenges, and address global issues.</strong> Over the next ten years, QField aims to make this vision a reality for everyone, everywhere.</p>

<p>Layers of cake, designed by QField ecosystem’s leading team members, were explained with 2034 in mind: intuitive and accessible to anyone wanting to map our world, while pioneering an innovative and collaborative app for the geospatial community. And last but not least: building strong and engaged communities to drive further adoption of the QField ecosystem.</p>
<p>This vision is taking shape through the forging of strategic partnerships with geospatial stakeholders: hardware manufacturers, ambassadors, trainers and technological partners. For the team, it is clear that good collaboration is <strong>key to building a healthy and sustainable ecosystem</strong>. Community as well as financial sustainability can become a strong reality with user groups, sponsors and crowdfundings.</p>
<p>And then it became reality: In the summer of 2024, heavy rains caused severe flooding in Switzerland and, suddenly, QField became a vital tool for supporting emergency response through data surveys and photo documentation.</p>

<p>With this emotional story, the technical lead, Mathieu took over and shared other QField <strong>success stories</strong> and <strong>several mapping use cases</strong> with partners in Finland and Tonga. But seamless fieldwork wouldn’t be possible without QFieldCloud, so Ivan provided an <strong>insight into the last years’ QFieldCloud enhancements</strong>, before diving into the busy server-side roadmap for 2025, which includes <strong>many new features</strong> related to the authentication, security, internationalization and performance. Finally, Zsanett shared QField product <strong>news and updates</strong>, including new storage capacities like WebDAV and new packaging capabilities. Last but not least, the new Fangorn version introduces <strong>new features developed by the evolving QField Community</strong>.</p>
<p>Building communities by sharing thoughts and ideas for the ecosystem is now possible through the <em><strong>ideas.qfield.cloud</strong></em> platform, open to everybody to suggest new ideas for QField.</p>
<p>The final topping of the (layer) cake: <strong>the new QField plugin framework</strong> was presented to the workshop attendees by Mathieu, who explained how the field workflow can be enhanced and optimized through the development of plugins – <strong>unique extensions that further personalize QField</strong>. For example, with the Routing Plugin, users can compute optimal ways between locations directly in QField using an external API. To make team efforts in the field even <strong>more efficient</strong>, the <em>Live Location Plugin</em> allows each team member to see the location of other members on the QField map, preventing debilification in the field.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the workshop ended with a Q&amp;A session, where several topics were addressed such as virtual reality, AI, machine learning, etc. This was followed by a happy and cheerful welcome drink with <strong>OPENGIS.ch</strong>partners. 🍻</p>
