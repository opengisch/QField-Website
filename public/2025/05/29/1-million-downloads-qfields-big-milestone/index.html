    <title>1 Million Downloads: QField&#39;s Big Milestone</title>

<meta name="description" content="🚀 QField has officially hit 1 million downloads – thanks to you! 🎉
Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush: QField has hit 1&#43; million downloads. What started as an ambitious open-source project has transformed into a global tool that&rsquo;s changing how professionals collect spatial data in the field. This big milestone is the result of years of dedication, with over 50,000 hours invested by our team. Our GeoNinjas contributed 14% of QGIS, while also driving open-source projects like ModelBaker and SwissLocator.Thank you for making GIS nerds the unsung heroes of fieldwork everywhere. Here&rsquo;s to changing the world, one field at a time!

<p>One million downloads might sound like just a number, but for us, it represents something much bigger. It&rsquo;s 1'000'000 times someone chose <strong>an innovative, flexible mobile mapping solution</strong>. It&rsquo;s 1’000’000 instances of fieldwork made <strong>easier</strong>, <strong>more</strong> <strong>efficient</strong>, and <strong>more</strong> <strong>accurate</strong>.</p>
<p>From humble beginnings to over 1 million downloads, QField has officially gone from “little app that could” to “open-source overachiever. <strong>”</strong> Thanks to the power of open source <em>(and probably some caffeine)</em>.</p>
