      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article describes a new algorithm for the processing modeler called feature filter algorithm. If you are already familiar with ETL concepts and the graphical modeler, you can directly jump to the section &lt;a href=&#34;#feature-filter-algorithm&#34;&gt;the feature filter algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-workflows-for-repetitive-tasks&#34;&gt;Building workflows for repetitive tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When building workflows for simple or complex geodata infrastructures, one of the most common tasks one encounters is to extract some of the features and copy them to another destination. Sometimes they need to be modified and a few attributes calculated or deleted, maybe even the geometry needs to be adjusted or in some fancy situations one even wants to generate a couple of objects from one input object. This process is often called &lt;em&gt;ETL&lt;/em&gt; (Extract, Transform, Load) and it is something that is worth mastering as a GIS expert.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a situation where we sent a field worker out to collect information about public infrastructure, equipped with a brand-new tablet and the latest and greatest version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qfield.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;QField&lt;/a&gt;. To make his task super easy, we prepare one single layer for him with an attribute type which can be set to Bus Station, Car Parking or Train Station. Now back in the office we want to integrate this back into our spatially enabled database which has been designed with 3 target tables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
