&lt;p>One of the most interesting new functionalities from this development cycle has been the ability to stamp details on photos taken by QField’s in-app camera. A basic version of this has been supported for a while now; this new version offers flexible customisation of details stamping onto photos, including changing the font size, colour, and horizontal position, as well as providing users with the ability to completely change the details via expression-driven templates and add image overlays onto the photo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Celebrating community, innovation, and open-source GIS in Sweden - AKA the QGIS user conference 2025</title><link>https://qfield.org/2025/06/25/celebrating-community-innovation-and-open-source-gis-in-sweden-aka-the-qgis-user-conference-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 04:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2025/06/25/celebrating-community-innovation-and-open-source-gis-in-sweden-aka-the-qgis-user-conference-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was such a pleasure to be part of the QGIS User Conference 2025 in Norrköping!

&lt;p>One of the most noticeable improvement in this version is the addition of “map preview rendering”. &lt;strong>QField now renders partial map content immediately beyond the edge of the screen&lt;/strong>, offering a much nicer experience when panning around as well as zooming in and out.

&lt;p>Even more exciting is that the converted QGIS project includes all the necessary settings for use with QField, thanks to a nifty QFieldCloud integration.

&lt;p>QField was created on June 8th, 2011, with its first commit titled “ &lt;em>added first script&lt;/em>”. Since then, it has grown into a powerful tool with a clear vision for the future: &lt;strong>to empower people to map and understand the world, tackle daily challenges, and address global issues.&lt;/strong> Over the next ten years, QField aims to make this vision a reality for everyone, everywhere.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField 3.5 “Fangorn”: Background tracking a reality!</title><link>https://qfield.org/2025/03/04/qfield-3-5-fangorn-background-tracking-a-reality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 05:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2025/03/04/qfield-3-5-fangorn-background-tracking-a-reality/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s not bury the lead here: the long-awaited capability to track position while QField is in the background or the device is locked has arrived in this brand-new version of QField.

&lt;p>As highlighted above, QField 3.5 has unlocked &lt;strong>background position tracking&lt;/strong> on the Android platform. This allows users to keep track of their positions even as they put QField in the background to conduct other tasks on their devices. It also means that tracking has become far more battery efficient, as users can lock/suspend their phones and tablets for long periods while QField continues to collect and track positions. On top of it all, this will work out of the book with internal GNSS as well as external high-precision GNSS devices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField 3.4 “Ebo”: Geofencing and processing out of the box</title><link>https://qfield.org/2024/10/08/qfield-3-4-ebo-geofencing-and-processing-out-of-the-box/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 04:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2024/10/08/qfield-3-4-ebo-geofencing-and-processing-out-of-the-box/</guid><description>&lt;p>QField 3.4 is out, and it won’t disappoint.

&lt;p>One of the biggest feature additions of this version is a brand new drawing tool that allows users to sketch out important details over captured photos or annotate drawing templates.

&lt;p>This new release introduces &lt;strong>project-defined tracking sessions, which are automatically activated when the project is loaded&lt;/strong>. Defined while setting up and tweaking a project on QGIS, these sessions permit the automated tracking of device positions without taking any action in QField beyond opening the project itself. This liberates field users from remembering to launch a session on app launch and lowers the knowledge required to collect such data.

&lt;p>One of the main improvements in this release is the brand-new functionality to enable &lt;strong>snapping to common angles&lt;/strong> while digitizing. When enabled, the coordinate cursor will snap to configured angles alongside a visual guideline. This comes in handy when adding new geometries while surveying features with regular angles (e.g. buildings, parking lots, etc.). As QField gets more digitizing functionalities, we’ve taken the time to implement a nifty UI that collapses digitizing toggle buttons into a drawer, &lt;strong>leaving extra space for the map canvas&lt;/strong> to shine through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OPENGIS.ch and Oslandia: A Strategic Partnership to Advance QField and QFieldCloud</title><link>https://qfield.org/2023/09/15/opengis-ch-and-oslandia-a-strategic-partnership-to-advance-qfield-and-qfieldcloud/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2023/09/15/opengis-ch-and-oslandia-a-strategic-partnership-to-advance-qfield-and-qfieldcloud/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="figure text-center mb-4">

&lt;p>For those who don’t know much about the concept of open source projects, a bit of background. Investing in open-source projects is a technical and ethical decision for OPENGIS.ch. Open source is a technological advantage, as we receive input from many developers worldwide who are motivated to work out the best possible software. It prevents our customers from vendor lock-in and allows complete ownership and control of the developed software. And finally, not only financially independent businesses and people should benefit from professional software but also those who might not have the financial means to pay for features, and licences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField 2.5 is here, reaching new heights</title><link>https://qfield.org/2022/11/14/qfield-2-5-is-here-reaching-new-heights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 09:37:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2022/11/14/qfield-2-5-is-here-reaching-new-heights/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our ninjas have been so busy that less than a month after we released QField 2.4, we find ourselves with so many new features we simply can&amp;rsquo;t wait any longer to present to you the latest version of QField: 2.5 &amp;ldquo;Fancy Flamingo ?”.&lt;/p>

Striking many Geo-scientist found the way to the Spitalgasse in Bern. The reason was the 26th GeoBeer event taking place at [ImpactHub](https:// &lt;a href="https://bern.impacthub.net/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bern.impacthub.net/)&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
[GeoBeer](https:// &lt;a href="https://www.geobeer.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.geobeer.ch&lt;/a>) is a quarterly meeting of people interested in geography, GIS, cartography and the latest technologies. It&amp;rsquo;s hosted every time by someone else. This time by us, OPENGIS.ch.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Right after the arriving, the organizers of GeoBeer Switzerland showed us some funny statistics about the GeoBeer participants since the very first GeoBeer event six years ago.&lt;br>
Marco Bernasocchi then welcomed everyone and introduced our company. We had three speakers this time. &lt;a href="https://www.bfh.ch/ti/de/ueber-das-ti/personen/5b7eblnby2di/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Hudritsch&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bfh_hesb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berner Fachhochschule&lt;/a> started by presenting the implementation of the visualization of historical buildings, that do not exist anymore in reality. But still, do in virtual reality… No sorry, it&amp;rsquo;s augmented reality. Marcus Hundritsch explained to us clearly the difference between AR and VR and presented some projects they made. [Pascal Bourquin](https:// &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BourquinPascal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/BourquinPascal&lt;/a>) changed perspective completely by telling us about his project (La Vie en Jaune) to cover all the hiking trails of Switzerland - he logs every trail done on a [map with photographs](https:// &lt;a href="https://map.lavieenjaune.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://map.lavieenjaune.ch/&lt;/a> ). The final speaker was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dani_viga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniele Viganò&lt;/a> from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gem_devs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Earthquake Model Foundation&lt;/a> talking about their challenges of calculating a global model of earthquake hazard, risk and exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField RC5 - Last call for testing</title><link>https://qfield.org/2019/03/14/qfield-rc5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 11:50:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2019/03/14/qfield-rc5/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are really happy to announce the fifth and (hopefully) last 1.0 release candidate in QField&amp;rsquo;s history!

&lt;p>Among the new features, the most important is the flashy new file selector with favorite directories (long press on a folder to add it to the favorites and longpress on the favorites list to remove it) and an automatic list of the last three opened projects that will save you heaps of time while looking for your projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You gave us feedback - we give you QField 1.0 RC3</title><link>https://qfield.org/2019/01/31/you-gave-us-feedback-we-give-you-qfield-1-0-rc2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 06:51:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2019/01/31/you-gave-us-feedback-we-give-you-qfield-1-0-rc2/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are really happy to announce the release a new great milestone in QField&amp;rsquo;s history, QField 1.0 Release Candidate 3!

If you are already familiar with ETL concepts and the graphical modeler, you can directly jump to the section &lt;a href="#feature-filter-algorithm">the feature filter algorithm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-workflows-for-repetitive-tasks">Building workflows for repetitive tasks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When building workflows for simple or complex geodata infrastructures, one of the most common tasks one encounters is to extract some of the features and copy them to another destination. Sometimes they need to be modified and a few attributes calculated or deleted, maybe even the geometry needs to be adjusted or in some fancy situations one even wants to generate a couple of objects from one input object. This process is often called &lt;em>ETL&lt;/em> (Extract, Transform, Load) and it is something that is worth mastering as a GIS expert.
Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a situation where we sent a field worker out to collect information about public infrastructure, equipped with a brand-new tablet and the latest and greatest version of &lt;a href="https://www.qfield.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QField&lt;/a>. To make his task super easy, we prepare one single layer for him with an attribute type which can be set to Bus Station, Car Parking or Train Station. Now back in the office we want to integrate this back into our spatially enabled database which has been designed with 3 target tables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PostgreSQL back end solution for quality assurance and data archive</title><link>https://qfield.org/2018/01/08/postgresql-back-end-solution-for-quality-assurance-and-data-archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 06:06:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2018/01/08/postgresql-back-end-solution-for-quality-assurance-and-data-archive/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Did you know that the possibilities to make a full QGIS back end solution for quality assurance and archiving in PostgreSQL are immense? SQL has it&amp;rsquo;s well known limitations, but with a little bit creativity you can make quite nice solutions just using triggers and rules. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what we did lately based on a project with a customer. He needed to assure the consistency of data but still give his employees the possibility of a fast feeding of the data collected on the field to the database. Another request was to keep every status of the data with the information about the changes (archiving).&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>
It&amp;rsquo;s always the question, where to put the logical part of the solution. QGIS is quite powerful with constraints, but the undeniable advantage of a back end solution is, that you can use any front end - no matter what configuration you have on QGIS or what Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) you use - without influencing the guarantee of data validity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField for Android 5</title><link>https://qfield.org/2015/12/01/qfield-for-android-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 13:44:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2015/12/01/qfield-for-android-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s done, finally we managed to get rid of Ministro so that we finally can say, QField runs on any android from 4.0.3 (ICS). This makes as of today (according to &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">google&lt;/a>) 96% of the android installations worldwide. Eventually we want to settle to 4.3 (JB) as minimum to allow us using certain features and avoiding &lt;a href="https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one known issue&lt;/a>, but for now it would mean cutting of another 25% of the users.
&lt;strong>So as of today it is: 4.0.3 (Ice cream sandwich API 15) is the required minimal Android version to run QField and Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean API 18) is the suggested minimal version.&lt;/strong>
We tested with 4.4, 5.0.1 and 5.1 but we haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to get our hands on an Android 6 so if you can, let us know how it works.
But adding support for android 5 isn&amp;rsquo;t the only great news, during the process we also:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField in the wild</title><link>https://qfield.org/2015/06/15/qfield-in-the-wild/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 12:05:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2015/06/15/qfield-in-the-wild/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="figure text-center mb-4">

&lt;p>QField Experimental is out, after a couple of months of requirements gathering, private early alpha testing and foremost tons of  emails requesting access to the testes group we decided today to put the current BETA version in the playstore. This means that from now on you can install QField just like any other android app by using the playstore.
It is important to remember that QField is still beta and thus it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all the features we want yet. Notably, &lt;em>there is no digitizing, due to a bug in android, Android 5 (Lollipop) is currently not supported (android 4.3 and 4.4 are suggested) and for now you need to manually copy the projects and data from the desktop to your device.&lt;/em>
QField is an Open Source project led by OPENGIS.ch LLC, more &lt;a href="https://qfield.org/android-gis/qfield/">information&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://qfield.opengis.ch/repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code&lt;/a> and a possibility to donate to the project can be found on the &lt;a href="https://qfield.org/android-gis/qfield/">QField page&lt;/a> (preferred) or by buying the QField for &lt;a href="https://qfield.opengis.ch/karma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QGIS Karma edition app&lt;/a>.

It is with great pleasure the we want to share with you the demo video of version 0.2.
Since the project is going to be one of our core projects, we set up a dedicated &lt;a href="https://qfield.org/android-gis/qgis-mobile/" title="QGIS mobile">page here&lt;/a>.
The &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/116231850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QGIS mobile 0.2&lt;/a> video demonstrates some basic functionality like navigation, feature identification and attribute editing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The performance is affected by android&amp;rsquo;s video recording software. In reality animaitons look fluent and the interface feels snappy.

After having worked individually in the last years, we have realized that there is a huge potential for us to join our knowledge - because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is why starting from January 1st, 2015 we are working together as OPENGIS.ch LLC.
Marco is the creator of QGIS for Android, has a strong background in python and web applications development and is core committer of the the award-winning InaSafe project.
Matthias is an active QGIS core committer with a long history in developing in a wide variety of programming languages and areas from embedded systems to server services.
We both are strong believers in open source software and are convinced that developing in the public is a big win for everybody.
Among other projects, we are currently working on QGIS Mobile. A touch optimized interface for field work, based on the QGIS libraries. Make sure you keep an eye on this project as it is in its infancy but growing very fast.
If you have a use-case for it and would like to support its development don’t hesitate contacting us. We will happily provide you with a preview version.

We are are also available for helping you with any idea and project you might have and to give ad-hoc courses that cover topics related to (Q)GIS and programming.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
