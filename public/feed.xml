&lt;p>To collect new data on bedrock geology and view existing geoscience data in the field. Geologic mapping is completed using paper maps and/or digital devices for data collection. The goal is to improve the geologic mapping workflow by entering data directly in the field, create quality data with consistent terms, and reference existing geoscience data in the field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="project-preparation">Project preparation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Prior to starting in QField, a geologic mapping geopackage was designed to collect vector data including point station, structure, photo, and sample layers as well as line and polygon layers for contacts, faults, alteration, and geology. Attribute fields are customized for ease of data entry and data quality assurance using value maps, defaults (value or expression), and constraints within the Attributes Form.

&lt;p>Communities in Fiji rely on landscape resources for agricultural and forestry-related activities. Accurate mapping and monitoring patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) over time at an appropriate scale is important for informing landscape management, policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. Fiji&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Forestry is collaboratively developing an approach with the Universities of Sydney (USYD), Western Australia (UWA) and the South Pacific (USP) to produce an inter-annual LULC map using Sentinel-2 satellite data, and freely available geospatial tools. QFIeld is being used for collecting ground truth data in the landscape for training and validation of the LULC map.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heritage Impact Assessment using QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The aim of this paper is to highlight the main benefits of using the QField app. An App that can be installed on an Android device for all archaeologists working in the field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main feature of this new application will allow the archaeologist to upload to his/her smartphone or tablet the .qgs project of the excavation based on the general information concerning the site that is already available to you. At this point, it is possible to implement the collection of data directly on site, maintaining constant updates to your system, thus allowing you to review the project throughout the excavation process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving Efficiencies in Ecological Surveying using QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/ecological-surveying/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/ecological-surveying/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="goal">Goal&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>To facilitate effective field work, regular consultation with the Ecology team is required to ensure that QField projects are prepared appropriately. Firstly, basemaps comprising aerial imagery and proposed development plans are prepared by georeferencing and constructing pyramids in QGIS. Point, line and polygon vector layers are then created to support digitisation and associated data collection. Using a range of widgets, attribute fields are customised to meet the requirements of the Ecology team. These include:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integration with QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/building-on-top/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/building-on-top/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="aims-and-objectives">Aims and Objectives&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Ghana&amp;rsquo;s Tano Offin Forest Reserve, one of the country&amp;rsquo;s most biodiverse areas supporting 569 species including seven globally threatened ones, faced a critical threat. Satellite imagery revealed that without intervention, the forest was projected to lose &lt;strong>56 hectares annually to illegal farming and logging activities.&lt;/strong> Traditional monitoring methods using &amp;ldquo;pen and paper&amp;rdquo; were insufficient to respond quickly to emerging deforestation threats detected by remote sensing. The Alliance of Bioversity International and &lt;a href="https://www.cgiar.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIAT&lt;/a>, working with local partners including the Ghana Forestry Commission, needed a way to rapidly ground-truth satellite alerts and engage local communities in real-time forest monitoring.

&lt;p>For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast. Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vanilla Surveys using QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/vanilla-surveys/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/vanilla-surveys/</guid><description>&lt;p>A field survey of vanilla plantations on Vava&amp;rsquo;u, an outer island in the Kingdom of Tonga, using QField was conducted in May and June 2020 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Food, and Fisheries (MAFF).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the most noticeable improvement in this version is the addition of “map preview rendering”. &lt;strong>QField now renders partial map content immediately beyond the edge of the screen&lt;/strong>, offering a much nicer experience when panning around as well as zooming in and out. Long-time QGIS users will recognise the behaviour, and we’re delighted to bring this experience to the field&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>XLSForm Converter: unlock a world of surveys with our brand new QGIS plugin</title><link>https://qfield.org/2025/06/02/xlsform-converter-unlock-a-world-of-surveys-with-our-brand-new-qgis-plugin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 04:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2025/06/02/xlsform-converter-unlock-a-world-of-surveys-with-our-brand-new-qgis-plugin/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today marks the initial release of our brand-new QGIS plugin, &lt;em>XLSForm Converter&lt;/em>.&lt;br>

&lt;p>QField was created on June 8th, 2011, with its first commit titled “ &lt;em>added first script&lt;/em>”. Since then, it has grown into a powerful tool with a clear vision for the future: &lt;strong>to empower people to map and understand the world, tackle daily challenges, and address global issues.&lt;/strong> Over the next ten years, QField aims to make this vision a reality for everyone, everywhere.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField 3.5 “Fangorn”: Background tracking a reality!</title><link>https://qfield.org/2025/03/04/qfield-3-5-fangorn-background-tracking-a-reality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 05:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2025/03/04/qfield-3-5-fangorn-background-tracking-a-reality/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s not bury the lead here: the long-awaited capability to track position while QField is in the background or the device is locked has arrived in this brand-new version of QField.

&lt;p>As highlighted above, QField 3.5 has unlocked &lt;strong>background position tracking&lt;/strong> on the Android platform. This allows users to keep track of their positions even as they put QField in the background to conduct other tasks on their devices. It also means that tracking has become far more battery efficient, as users can lock/suspend their phones and tablets for long periods while QField continues to collect and track positions. On top of it all, this will work out of the book with internal GNSS as well as external high-precision GNSS devices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField 3.4 “Ebo”: Geofencing and processing out of the box</title><link>https://qfield.org/2024/10/08/qfield-3-4-ebo-geofencing-and-processing-out-of-the-box/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 04:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2024/10/08/qfield-3-4-ebo-geofencing-and-processing-out-of-the-box/</guid><description>&lt;p>QField 3.4 is out, and it won’t disappoint.

&lt;p>This new release introduces &lt;strong>project-defined tracking sessions, which are automatically activated when the project is loaded&lt;/strong>. Defined while setting up and tweaking a project on QGIS, these sessions permit the automated tracking of device positions without taking any action in QField beyond opening the project itself. This liberates field users from remembering to launch a session on app launch and lowers the knowledge required to collect such data.

&lt;p>One of the main improvements in this release is the brand-new functionality to enable &lt;strong>snapping to common angles&lt;/strong> while digitizing. When enabled, the coordinate cursor will snap to configured angles alongside a visual guideline. This comes in handy when adding new geometries while surveying features with regular angles (e.g. buildings, parking lots, etc.). As QField gets more digitizing functionalities, we’ve taken the time to implement a nifty UI that collapses digitizing toggle buttons into a drawer, &lt;strong>leaving extra space for the map canvas&lt;/strong> to shine through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OPENGIS.ch and Oslandia: A Strategic Partnership to Advance QField and QFieldCloud</title><link>https://qfield.org/2023/09/15/opengis-ch-and-oslandia-a-strategic-partnership-to-advance-qfield-and-qfieldcloud/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2023/09/15/opengis-ch-and-oslandia-a-strategic-partnership-to-advance-qfield-and-qfieldcloud/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="figure text-center mb-4">

&lt;p>For those who don’t know much about the concept of open source projects, a bit of background. Investing in open-source projects is a technical and ethical decision for OPENGIS.ch. Open source is a technological advantage, as we receive input from many developers worldwide who are motivated to work out the best possible software. It prevents our customers from vendor lock-in and allows complete ownership and control of the developed software. And finally, not only financially independent businesses and people should benefit from professional software but also those who might not have the financial means to pay for features, and licences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField 2.5 is here, reaching new heights</title><link>https://qfield.org/2022/11/14/qfield-2-5-is-here-reaching-new-heights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 09:37:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2022/11/14/qfield-2-5-is-here-reaching-new-heights/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our ninjas have been so busy that less than a month after we released QField 2.4, we find ourselves with so many new features we simply can&amp;rsquo;t wait any longer to present to you the latest version of QField: 2.5 &amp;ldquo;Fancy Flamingo ?”.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>QField’s main new feature of this 2.5 release cycle is its brand new elevation profiling functionality which has been added to the measuring tool. Users are now able to dynamically build and analyze elevation profiles wherever they are - in the field or on their desktop - by simply drawing paths onto their maps and projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Best of Swiss Enterprise App Award for QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/2022/11/03/best-of-swiss-enterprise-app-award-for-qfield/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 13:02:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2022/11/03/best-of-swiss-enterprise-app-award-for-qfield/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>What a night it was.

It was my first participation and all I knew was that it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be an unconference.

&lt;p>The example below demonstrates a scenario where animated raster markers are used to highlight active fires within the visible map extent.

&lt;p>&lt;em>TLDR: Since November 2021, Google has enforced new storage access limitations for apps published on its Play store which prohibits direct storage access on Android 11 and above forcing QField to adapt and rely on importing projects and datasets to access those.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you are a QField beta user on Android 11 and above, you might have noticed a significant change in the way the app is handling storage in the latest set of betas released in early February of 2022. This blog post will go over the changes, explain why those &lt;strong>had to be made&lt;/strong> (looking at you, Google), how to work in this new paradigm, and showcase some new benefits from the hard work done by OPENGIS.ch’s geoninjas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField collected data crucial in disaster relief after Tonga’s volcanic eruption</title><link>https://qfield.org/2022/02/02/qfield-data-crucial-in-disaster-relief-after-tongas-volcanic-eruption/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 06:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2022/02/02/qfield-data-crucial-in-disaster-relief-after-tongas-volcanic-eruption/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>For once, it&amp;rsquo;s not an app from the Silicon Valley, but from Laax in the Swiss Alps that made the news.

But still, do in virtual reality… No sorry, it&amp;rsquo;s augmented reality. Marcus Hundritsch explained to us clearly the difference between AR and VR and presented some projects they made. [Pascal Bourquin](https:// &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BourquinPascal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/BourquinPascal&lt;/a>) changed perspective completely by telling us about his project (La Vie en Jaune) to cover all the hiking trails of Switzerland - he logs every trail done on a [map with photographs](https:// &lt;a href="https://map.lavieenjaune.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://map.lavieenjaune.ch/&lt;/a> ). The final speaker was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dani_viga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniele Viganò&lt;/a> from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gem_devs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Earthquake Model Foundation&lt;/a> talking about their challenges of calculating a global model of earthquake hazard, risk and exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField RC5 - Last call for testing</title><link>https://qfield.org/2019/03/14/qfield-rc5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 11:50:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2019/03/14/qfield-rc5/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are really happy to announce the fifth and (hopefully) last 1.0 release candidate in QField&amp;rsquo;s history!

If you are already familiar with ETL concepts and the graphical modeler, you can directly jump to the section &lt;a href="#feature-filter-algorithm">the feature filter algorithm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-workflows-for-repetitive-tasks">Building workflows for repetitive tasks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When building workflows for simple or complex geodata infrastructures, one of the most common tasks one encounters is to extract some of the features and copy them to another destination. Sometimes they need to be modified and a few attributes calculated or deleted, maybe even the geometry needs to be adjusted or in some fancy situations one even wants to generate a couple of objects from one input object. This process is often called &lt;em>ETL&lt;/em> (Extract, Transform, Load) and it is something that is worth mastering as a GIS expert.
Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a situation where we sent a field worker out to collect information about public infrastructure, equipped with a brand-new tablet and the latest and greatest version of &lt;a href="https://www.qfield.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QField&lt;/a>. To make his task super easy, we prepare one single layer for him with an attribute type which can be set to Bus Station, Car Parking or Train Station. Now back in the office we want to integrate this back into our spatially enabled database which has been designed with 3 target tables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PostgreSQL back end solution for quality assurance and data archive</title><link>https://qfield.org/2018/01/08/postgresql-back-end-solution-for-quality-assurance-and-data-archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 06:06:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2018/01/08/postgresql-back-end-solution-for-quality-assurance-and-data-archive/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Did you know that the possibilities to make a full QGIS back end solution for quality assurance and archiving in PostgreSQL are immense? SQL has it&amp;rsquo;s well known limitations, but with a little bit creativity you can make quite nice solutions just using triggers and rules. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what we did lately based on a project with a customer. He needed to assure the consistency of data but still give his employees the possibility of a fast feeding of the data collected on the field to the database. Another request was to keep every status of the data with the information about the changes (archiving).&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>
It&amp;rsquo;s always the question, where to put the logical part of the solution. QGIS is quite powerful with constraints, but the undeniable advantage of a back end solution is, that you can use any front end - no matter what configuration you have on QGIS or what Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) you use - without influencing the guarantee of data validity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField for Android 5</title><link>https://qfield.org/2015/12/01/qfield-for-android-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 13:44:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2015/12/01/qfield-for-android-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s done, finally we managed to get rid of Ministro so that we finally can say, QField runs on any android from 4.0.3 (ICS). This makes as of today (according to &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">google&lt;/a>) 96% of the android installations worldwide. Eventually we want to settle to 4.3 (JB) as minimum to allow us using certain features and avoiding &lt;a href="https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one known issue&lt;/a>, but for now it would mean cutting of another 25% of the users.
&lt;strong>So as of today it is: 4.0.3 (Ice cream sandwich API 15) is the required minimal Android version to run QField and Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean API 18) is the suggested minimal version.&lt;/strong>
We tested with 4.4, 5.0.1 and 5.1 but we haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to get our hands on an Android 6 so if you can, let us know how it works.
But adding support for android 5 isn&amp;rsquo;t the only great news, during the process we also:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QField in the wild</title><link>https://qfield.org/2015/06/15/qfield-in-the-wild/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 12:05:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/2015/06/15/qfield-in-the-wild/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="figure text-center mb-4">

&lt;p>QField Experimental is out, after a couple of months of requirements gathering, private early alpha testing and foremost tons of  emails requesting access to the testes group we decided today to put the current BETA version in the playstore. This means that from now on you can install QField just like any other android app by using the playstore.
It is important to remember that QField is still beta and thus it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all the features we want yet. Notably, &lt;em>there is no digitizing, due to a bug in android, Android 5 (Lollipop) is currently not supported (android 4.3 and 4.4 are suggested) and for now you need to manually copy the projects and data from the desktop to your device.&lt;/em>
QField is an Open Source project led by OPENGIS.ch LLC, more &lt;a href="https://qfield.org/android-gis/qfield/">information&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://qfield.opengis.ch/repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code&lt;/a> and a possibility to donate to the project can be found on the &lt;a href="https://qfield.org/android-gis/qfield/">QField page&lt;/a> (preferred) or by buying the QField for &lt;a href="https://qfield.opengis.ch/karma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QGIS Karma edition app&lt;/a>.

It is with great pleasure the we want to share with you the demo video of version 0.2.
Since the project is going to be one of our core projects, we set up a dedicated &lt;a href="https://qfield.org/android-gis/qgis-mobile/" title="QGIS mobile">page here&lt;/a>.
The &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/116231850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QGIS mobile 0.2&lt;/a> video demonstrates some basic functionality like navigation, feature identification and attribute editing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The performance is affected by android&amp;rsquo;s video recording software. In reality animaitons look fluent and the interface feels snappy.

After having worked individually in the last years, we have realized that there is a huge potential for us to join our knowledge - because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is why starting from January 1st, 2015 we are working together as OPENGIS.ch LLC.
Marco is the creator of QGIS for Android, has a strong background in python and web applications development and is core committer of the the award-winning InaSafe project.
Matthias is an active QGIS core committer with a long history in developing in a wide variety of programming languages and areas from embedded systems to server services.
We both are strong believers in open source software and are convinced that developing in the public is a big win for everybody.
Among other projects, we are currently working on QGIS Mobile. A touch optimized interface for field work, based on the QGIS libraries. Make sure you keep an eye on this project as it is in its infancy but growing very fast.
If you have a use-case for it and would like to support its development don’t hesitate contacting us. We will happily provide you with a preview version.

We are are also available for helping you with any idea and project you might have and to give ad-hoc courses that cover topics related to (Q)GIS and programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Public Digital Good Supporting Sustainable Development Goals</title><link>https://qfield.org/sdgs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/sdgs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>All</title><link>https://qfield.org/all/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/all/</guid><description>archives</description></item><item><title>QField for Academic Field Studies</title><link>https://qfield.org/solutions/academic-field-studies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/solutions/academic-field-studies/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-you-can-do">What you can do&lt;/h2>
