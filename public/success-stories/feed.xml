&lt;p>To collect new data on bedrock geology and view existing geoscience data in the field. Geologic mapping is completed using paper maps and/or digital devices for data collection. The goal is to improve the geologic mapping workflow by entering data directly in the field, create quality data with consistent terms, and reference existing geoscience data in the field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="project-preparation">Project preparation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Prior to starting in QField, a geologic mapping geopackage was designed to collect vector data including point station, structure, photo, and sample layers as well as line and polygon layers for contacts, faults, alteration, and geology. Attribute fields are customized for ease of data entry and data quality assurance using value maps, defaults (value or expression), and constraints within the Attributes Form. For example, the structural layer includes:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ground Truth Data Collection Using QField for LULC Mapping in Fiji</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/ground-truth-fiji/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/ground-truth-fiji/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="purpose">Purpose&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Communities in Fiji rely on landscape resources for agricultural and forestry-related activities. Accurate mapping and monitoring patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) over time at an appropriate scale is important for informing landscape management, policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. Fiji&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Forestry is collaboratively developing an approach with the Universities of Sydney (USYD), Western Australia (UWA) and the South Pacific (USP) to produce an inter-annual LULC map using Sentinel-2 satellite data, and freely available geospatial tools. QFIeld is being used for collecting ground truth data in the landscape for training and validation of the LULC map.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heritage Impact Assessment using QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The aim of this paper is to highlight the main benefits of using the QField app. An App that can be installed on an Android device for all archaeologists working in the field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main feature of this new application will allow the archaeologist to upload to his/her smartphone or tablet the .qgs project of the excavation based on the general information concerning the site that is already available to you. At this point, it is possible to implement the collection of data directly on site, maintaining constant updates to your system, thus allowing you to review the project throughout the excavation process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving Efficiencies in Ecological Surveying using QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/ecological-surveying/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/ecological-surveying/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="goal">Goal&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>To facilitate effective field work, regular consultation with the Ecology team is required to ensure that QField projects are prepared appropriately. Firstly, basemaps comprising aerial imagery and proposed development plans are prepared by georeferencing and constructing pyramids in QGIS. Point, line and polygon vector layers are then created to support digitisation and associated data collection. Using a range of widgets, attribute fields are customised to meet the requirements of the Ecology team. These include:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integration with QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/building-on-top/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/building-on-top/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="aims-and-objectives">Aims and Objectives&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Ghana&amp;rsquo;s Tano Offin Forest Reserve, one of the country&amp;rsquo;s most biodiverse areas supporting 569 species including seven globally threatened ones, faced a critical threat. Satellite imagery revealed that without intervention, the forest was projected to lose &lt;strong>56 hectares annually to illegal farming and logging activities.&lt;/strong> Traditional monitoring methods using &amp;ldquo;pen and paper&amp;rdquo; were insufficient to respond quickly to emerging deforestation threats detected by remote sensing. The Alliance of Bioversity International and &lt;a href="https://www.cgiar.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIAT&lt;/a>, working with local partners including the Ghana Forestry Commission, needed a way to rapidly ground-truth satellite alerts and engage local communities in real-time forest monitoring. The challenge was particularly complex given the rural setting where many community members had limited literacy and technology experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tonga Crop Survey using QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/tonga/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/tonga/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="context">Context&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast. Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vanilla Surveys using QField</title><link>https://qfield.org/success-stories/vanilla-surveys/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 11:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://qfield.org/success-stories/vanilla-surveys/</guid><description>&lt;p>A field survey of vanilla plantations on Vava&amp;rsquo;u, an outer island in the Kingdom of Tonga, using QField was conducted in May and June 2020 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Food, and Fisheries (MAFF).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vanilla is an important commercial crop in Vava&amp;rsquo;u. The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected.
