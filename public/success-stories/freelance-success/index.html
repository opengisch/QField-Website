  <p>What started as a simple request from former colleagues has evolved into a freelance business and a popular open source project. Meet Felix, a French geomatician who discovered an innovative way to build trust, showcase expertise, and create sustainable income—all while giving away his software for free.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-naturalists-without-the-right-tools">The Problem: Naturalists Without the Right Tools</h3>
<p>Felix&rsquo;s story begins in the environmental consulting world, where ecologists and naturalists face a common challenge. These professionals spend their days in the field documenting biodiversity—cataloging birds, plants, and other species for environmental impact studies. While they&rsquo;re experts in their scientific domains, many struggle with the technical aspects of data collection.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re using QGIS because they have to, but they&rsquo;re not great at it. Usually it&rsquo;s just to make maps—they make horrible maps”.</em></p>
<p>When Felix left his previous company, former colleagues approached him with a familiar pain point. They had lost access to their company&rsquo;s field data collection software and needed something they could use independently. Their attempts with QField hadn&rsquo;t been successful, and they were willing to pay for a solution.</p>
<h3 id="the-open-source-gamble">The Open Source Gamble</h3>
<p>Initially, Felix built a custom QGIS project for QField as a one-off paid commission. But as more people began asking for similar solutions, he faced a crucial business decision. Rather than trying to sell individual licenses, Felix made what seemed like a counterintuitive choice: he released everything as open source.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the naturalist world, they don&rsquo;t have a lot of money to invest in this kind of technology,&rdquo;</em> Felix reflects.<em>&ldquo;It was a bit too much for them to put money on this when they could just do it by themselves.</em></p>
<p>But Felix&rsquo;s open source decision wasn&rsquo;t altruistic—it was strategic. He realized that giving away the software could become his best marketing tool.</p>
<h3 id="the-trust-building-business-model">The Trust-Building Business Model</h3>
<p>Felix&rsquo;s approach flips the traditional software business model on its head. Instead of selling licenses, he uses his open source QField project as a demonstration of expertise and a trust-building mechanism.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works:<br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Enable data collection - The open source project helps naturalists collect field data efficiently, solving their immediate technical challenge.<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Build relationships - Users know Felix as the creator of the tool that solved their problem, establishing him as a trusted expert.<br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Monetize expertise - When users need help processing data, creating visualizations, or training their teams, they naturally turn to Felix for consulting services.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That was to me like the first advertisement for my job,&rdquo;</em> Felix explains.<em>&ldquo;A lot of people contacted me afterward because they had trouble with the data when they got it back on QGIS and had to forward it to other companies.&rdquo;</em>__</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-right-audience">Finding the Right Audience</h3>
<p>Rather than competing in the crowded general GIS market, Felix identified a specific niche where he could add unique value. His target audience is highly specific: French naturalists and ecologists working in small companies or as freelancers, who need to collect biodiversity data using Latin species names.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I had more knowledge in this specific domain than other GIS specialists, and I had more GIS knowledge than anyone in this field,&rdquo;</em> Felix notes. This positioning allows him to command premium rates because he understands both the technical and domain-specific challenges his clients face.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves. Despite targeting a narrow audience, Felix&rsquo;s latest project version has garnered 500 downloads—impressive numbers for such a specialized tool.</p>
<h3 id="marketing-through-value">Marketing Through Value</h3>
<p>Felix&rsquo;s marketing strategy centers on demonstrating value rather than making sales pitches. On LinkedIn, where his target audience is most active, he shares completed projects and discusses his open source work.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s way easier to advertise when it&rsquo;s not just random pictures saying &lsquo;I will make this blah blah blah,&rsquo;&rdquo;</em> Felix explains.<em>&ldquo;You get a project that I made and you can check by yourself if it&rsquo;s good or not.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This approach resonates because it addresses a common freelancer challenge: building credibility without seeming pushy. The open source project serves as a portfolio piece that potential clients can actually test and evaluate.</p>
<h3 id="the-community-effect">The Community Effect</h3>
<p>What started as a business strategy has evolved into genuine community building. Felix has partnered with Augustin, a botanist, to create a Discord server where users can suggest improvements and discuss features. The next version of their project will be developed collaboratively rather than by Felix alone.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually a switch—it&rsquo;s a bit of democracy, the way we can improve collectively,&rdquo;</em> Felix says. This community-driven approach not only improves the software but also strengthens the network of professionals who might become future clients.</p>
<h3 id="looking-forward-plugins-and-possibilities">Looking Forward: Plugins and Possibilities</h3>
<p>Felix is particularly excited about QField&rsquo;s plugin platform, which he sees as opening &ldquo;a Pandora&rsquo;s box for all kinds of applications.&rdquo; He envisions integrating tools like PlantNet&rsquo;s AI-powered species identification, creating workflows where users can photograph a plant, get AI-assisted species identification, and seamlessly incorporate that data into their field surveys.</p>
